Pig Game
Very nice game!
Good DRY code. Simple and functional!
Your commenting between lines makes it very easy to understand a read- and that is excellent when working in a team,
or going over your code.
The styling of the game is also great ! The dimming of sides when a players turn changes- I love it!
You displayed here knowledge of DOM manipulation, advanced methods, Math methods,events.
You also incorporated functions very well.
I would make it a little clearer on who the winner is when the game is over with a restart game button. 
But thats really minor compared to all the wonderful code you wrote!
Great job! Keep at it.
